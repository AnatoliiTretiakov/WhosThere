Are you working from home because of the pandemic? And are you missing the office? If yes, please continue, otherwise stop right here.

Great, we have the wish for returning to the office in common :-) If your employer decided to use [1.50 office](https://www.1-50-office.de) to handle the booking of office desks, **WhosThere** is everything you ever wished for, and more!

Wouldn't it be nice to see who else is in the office? And how about beeing getting an alert to put on some trousers if your boss signed in?
